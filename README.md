## 📄 About
**Amazonia** is a simple terminal game developed in Python. 
The goal is to survive in the "jungle" by making strategic decisions to progress through the game.

The game is based on features such as: 
- Choose a **class** hunter or fisher.
- **Eat** to fill your hunger bar.
- **Sleep** to recover energy.
- **Fish** or **Hunt** to obtain food, but beware of bad surprises.
- **Save** your progress and continue later.

This project aims to deepen our knowledge in Python.
